| **Case Study Report**          | $60$%   (a written report submission)    |


<ins>**The overall module pass mark is 40%**</ins>. The practical exercise requires you to demonstrate the use of security tools for network analysis and network protection tasks. This will cover topics 1-4 and the practice lab exercises. The case study report requires you to analyse a scenario describing a company’s network. In your report you must propose how the company should improve their network security. This assessment covers all topics.
